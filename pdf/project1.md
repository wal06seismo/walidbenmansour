## Physical state and thermochemical structure: Antarctica

**Project description:** Antarctica has always been the least understood continent in terms of geophysical structure as well as geological history. With more than 98% of the land surface covered with ice, geological sampling can only occur at very limited locations and is largely restricted to coastal regions or within the Transantarctic Mountains, which cross the continent, separating cratonic East Antarctica from West Antarctica. Thus, even fundamental geologic knowledge such as the age of various geographic provinces is generally missing. Antarctica is the largest land mass covered by continental-scale ice sheets, and thus
represents a unique opportunity to study the interactions of large ice sheets with the solid earth. Earth structure beneath the ice sheet influences ice dynamics in several important ways and plays a significant role in ice sheet evolution.
