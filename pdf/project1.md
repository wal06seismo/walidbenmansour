## Physical state and thermochemical structure: Antarctica

**Project description:** Antarctica has always been the least understood continent in terms of geophysical structure as well as geological history. With more than 98% of the land surface covered with ice, geological sampling can only occur at very limited locations and is largely restricted to coastal regions or within the Transantarctic Mountains, which cross the continent, separating cratonic East Antarctica from West Antarctica. Thus, even fundamental geologic knowledge such as the age of various geographic provinces is generally missing.
