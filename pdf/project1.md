## Physical state and thermochemical structure: Antarctica

**Project description:** Antarctica has always been the least understood continent in terms of geophysical structure as well as geological history. With more than 98% of the land surface covered with ice, geological sampling can only occur at very limited locations and is largely restricted to coastal regions or within the Transantarctic Mountains, which cross the continent, separating cratonic East Antarctica from West Antarctica. Thus, even fundamental geologic knowledge such as the age of various geographic provinces is generally missing. Antarctica is the largest land mass covered by continental-scale ice sheets, and thus
represents a unique opportunity to study the interactions of large ice sheets with the solid earth. Earth structure beneath the ice sheet influences ice dynamics in several important ways and plays a significant role in ice sheet evolution.

## Thermochemical tomography
**Methodology:** We apply a multi-observable probabilistic inversion method. This is a joint inversion approach specifically designed to retrieve the physical state (e.g. temperature distribution, compositional structure,stress/strain distributions, etc.) of the lithosphere and sublithospheric upper mantle by inverting key data sets with complementary sensitivities to the main fields of interest. The inverse problem is cast into a statistical (Bayesian) inference problem considering all major sources of uncertainty. The solution to the inverse problem is a multi-dimensional probability distribution over the parameters of interest, known as the posterior distribution.  Since this distribution has no analytical solution, we estimate it by constructing a Markov chain that has the posterior has its equilibrium distribution. In contrast to more traditional inversion methods, we invert directly for are the main thermodynamic variables temperature, pressure and composition.  The link between these primary parameters and the physical parameters needed to solve the forward problems (e.g. bulk density, bulk modulus) isprovided by a full thermodynamic model and an internally-consistent thermodynamic database. Such a consistency is key to guaranteeing that our models will not violate fundamental thermodynamic relations.

**Results:** coming soon ...
