## Multi-observables thermochemical tomography of Central and southern Africa


**Project description:** Central and southern Africa is a geologically intriguing region made up of several cratonic blocks separated by metamorphic belts or sedimentary basins and showing exceptional geophysical and geodynamic features (e.g. Bangui magnetic anomaly in central Africa, Beattie magnetic anomaly in south Africa, uplift of the Angolan passive margin and South Africa, shortening of the crust in East Africa). Knowledge of the present-day thermochemical structure (temperature and major-element composition) of the lithosphere and sub-lithospheric upper mantle is key to understanding the relationships between internal Earth dynamics, surface observables (e.g. topography, gravity) and the location of mineral and energy resources (e.g. diamondiferous kimberlites) in this region. Here we apply a 3D multi-observable inversion method based on a probabilistic (Bayesian) formalism using high-quality geophysical, geochemical and geological datasets. This framework allows us to move beyond classic inversion schemes and jointly invert multiple seismic data (e.g. surface wave, receiver functions, etc) and non-seismic data (geothermal, topography, potential fields, etc) to retrieve estimates of the thermal, magnetic and lithological structures beneath Central and southern Africa.

## Thermochemical tomography
**Methodology:** We apply a multi-observable probabilistic inversion method. This is a joint inversion approach specifically designed to retrieve the physical state (e.g. temperature distribution, compositional structure,stress/strain distributions, etc.) of the lithosphere and sublithospheric upper mantle by inverting key data sets with complementary sensitivities to the main fields of interest. The inverse problem is cast into a statistical (Bayesian) inference problem considering all major sources of uncertainty. The solution to the inverse problem is a multi-dimensional probability distribution over the parameters of interest, known as the posterior distribution. Since this distribution has no analytical solution, we estimate it by constructing a Markov chain that has the posterior has its equilibrium distribution. In contrast to more traditional inversion methods, we invert directly for are the main thermodynamic variables temperature, pressure and composition. The link between these primary parameters and the physical parameters needed to solve the forward problems (e.g. bulk density, bulk modulus) isprovided by a full thermodynamic model and an internally-consistent thermodynamic database. Such a consistency is key to guaranteeing that our models will not violate fundamental thermodynamic relations.

## Ambient seismic noise
In spite of the deployment of several temporary  and permanent broadband seismic instruments since mid 1990's, the physical state of the crustal and upper mantle properties of central and southern Africa is poorly known. The main challenge here is to use 20 years of ambient seismic noise recorded by these different arrays and stored on four datacenters (IRIS, GEOFON, RESIF, SEIS-UK). Due to the politic and geographical issues, the seismic stations are focused on East African Rifts, the Kalahari Craton, Damara orogeny and the Cameroon Volcanic belts.

**Methods:** We collect vertical component of each station to recover the Rayleigh wave Green's functions (Gf's) for each raypath. Cross-correlation technique is a well establish technique to extract surface wave information from long time seismic noise recording and analysis shear wave velocity variations across a seismic array (Shapiro and Campillo, 2004; Shapiro and Campillo, 2005; Sabra et al. 2005). Because we have a series of temporary network which recorded seismic noise at different period of time, it is impossible to exploit the full potential paths suggested by the seismic station distribution. Cross-correlograms were computed for different station pairs following a standard pre-processing scheme. After removing the instrument responses, seismic data were decimated to 1 Hz and processed as daily records at each station. All records were band-pass filtered between 5 s and 150 s, and then we applied time domain normalization to remove the effects of earthquakes and non-stationary noise source. as earthquakes, instrument irregularities and non stationary noise source near to the station. This method computes the running average of the absolute value of the waveform in a normalization time window of fixed length and weights the waveform at the centre of the window by the inverse of this average. We also applied spectral normalization for each record to avoid significant spectral imbalance and to broaden the bandwidth of the ambient noise (Bensen et al., 2007, Lin et al., 2007). To extract Rayleigh wave dispersion curves information from cross-correlogram, we use the Frequency Time Analysis (FTAN) technique with a phase-matched filter applied to measure phase velocity dispersion curves (Levshin and Ritzwoller, 2001). The intrinsic 2π phase ambiguity of phase measurements was resolved using the global phase velocity reference model (Ekström, 2011). The Rayleigh phase dispersion measurements between 6 s and 80 s periods were used to invert for 2-D phase velocity maps on a spatial grid by applying a linear ray theoretic tomographic method (Zhao et al., 2020) }
