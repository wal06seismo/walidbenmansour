## Seismic study of the crust beneath the Northern Scandinavian mountains


**Project description:**
Conventional plate tectonic theory does not explain why parts of the continental crust significant distances from plate margins should move vertically, sometimes by substantial amounts (> 1 km). Such uplift events result in the rejuvenation of sediment source regions and can trigger the development of major reservoir sand sequences. Intraplate stress, dynamic support, and mantle upwelling have been invoked to account for such ‘Epeirogenic’ events but few quantitative observations exist which distinguish between competing theories. A substantial body of stratigraphic and geo-chronological evidence [1] suggests the Scandinavian mountains formed a high plateau region, at an altitude of c. 2 km above mean sea-level, during the Neogene c. 20 Ma ago, well before the onset of Quaternary glaciation. Neogene uplift and associated erosion has been the primary control on much of the present bathymetry and coastline of northern Europe [2] and was a major source of sediment supply to the North Sea and Norwegian continental slopes and margins. Paleogene uplift of northern Europe is attributed to North Atlantic opening and associated magmatic underplating but this cannot explain the more recent widespread Neogene uplift.The prime objective of this project is to attempt to identify the underlying cause of this uplift. This will be achieved by acquiring new passive seismic data.

## Receiver functions
**Method:** Here, we use ZRT (vertical, radial and transverse) receiver functions calculated using the frequency domain method with a water level deconvolution (Ammon 1991; Clayton & Wiggins 1976; Langston 1979). The deconvolution removes source and propagation path affects from receiver effects after rotating the three-component waveforms to the backazimuth of the source path. This results in radial (ER) and transverse (ET) receiver functions. The water level is adjusted to the minimum value necessary to stabilize the deconvolution. In this study, a mean value of 10^−2 was selected, which reflects the relatively low signal-to-noise levels in much of the data. A Gaussian filter of width 2.0 was chosen which corresponds to a centre frequency of 1 Hz. Transverse receiver functions were used to identify noisy functions and the possibility of complex dipping structure beneath the station.
