## Plume interaction and spreading ridge: Galapagos archipelagos

**Project description:** Hot spot volcanism is widely thought to be the result of upwelling and melting of hot, buoyant mantle [Morgan, 1971]. About 21 of the proposed 30 to 50 hot spots on Earth are, however, located near mid-ocean ridges and interact with young, thin lithosphere, resulting in geomorphological and geochemical anomalies along the spreading axes (e.g. Christie et al., 2005, Detrick et al., 2002, Ito et al., 2003, Sinton et al., 2003). While plume material can influence nearby ridges for distances of up to 1000 km along-axis (Schilling et al., 1976, Schilling et al., 1982, Vogt, 1976), the extent to which plume material that a) does not how into the ridge system spreads laterally along the base of the lithosphere away from the ridge axis and b) affects the chemical composition of the upper mantle (asthenosphere and possibly lithosphere) is still poorly constrained.

The Gal치pagos archipelago, located west of Ecuador, is a good example where a mantle plume interacts with a spreading center and modifies physical and chemical properties of the oceanic lithosphere. The Gal치pagos Spreading Center (GSC) and the Gal치pagos hotspot interact over more than 1,000 km with unusual features for a hot spot region (large number of historical active volcanoes, large range of lavas composition, alignment of volcanic centers and seamounts). To bring new information on the physical and chemical properties of this region, we are constructing a new P-wave velocity model of this region by combining data from 10 seismic broadband stations and from 9 MERMAIDS (Mobile Earthquake Recorder in Marine Areas by Independent Divers) deployed in this region between 2014 and 2016. We focus on Pn head waves to better constraint the Moho depth in this region and image the interaction between the hot spot and the GSC. We selected 150 seismic events between May 2014 and September 2016, with epicentral distance between 3o and 35o and picked more than 2,500 Pn phases that we will invert in a probabilistic tomography inversion in a second step. In this presentation, we will show examples and statistics of Pn data. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of a thermochemical tomography in this region to get temperature and major-element composition of the lithosphere and sub-lithospheric upper mantle. These new results could bring important information and implication of the current models of hot spots and their interactions with oceanic lithosphere.
