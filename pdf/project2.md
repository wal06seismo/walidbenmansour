## Plume interaction and spreading ridge: Galapagos archipelagos

**Project description:** Hot spot volcanism is widely thought to be the result of upwelling and melting of hot, buoyant mantle [Morgan, 1971]. About 21 of the proposed 30 to 50 hot spots on Earth are, however, located near mid-ocean ridges and interact with young, thin lithosphere, resulting in geomorphological and geochemical anomalies along the spreading axes (e.g. Christie et al., 2005, Detrick et al., 2002, Ito et al., 2003, Sinton et al., 2003). While plume material can influence nearby ridges for distances of up to 1000 km along-axis (Schilling et al., 1976, Schilling et al., 1982, Vogt, 1976), the extent to which plume material that a) does not how into the ridge system spreads laterally along the base of the lithosphere away from the ridge axis and b) affects the chemical composition of the upper mantle (asthenosphere and possibly lithosphere) is still poorly constrained.

The Galapagos Archipelago is thought to be the surface expression of a long-lived mantle plume (e.g. Duncan and Hargraves, 1984, Morgan, 1971), originating from the earth's lower mantle (Graham et al., 1993, Montelli et al., 2006). Several unique features make the Galapagos Archipelago dierent from more conventional hot spots such as Hawaii. First, while volcanism shows a general age progression in the direction of plate motion, the progression is not monotonic; almost all of the Galapagos Islands have erupted in the Holocene [Simkin and Siebert, 1994]. Second, geochemical signatures of basalts show an unusual spatial distribution: depleted basalts appear near the center and northeastern part of archipelago, while enriched lavas appear primarily along the western and southern parts [White and Hofmann, 1978; Geist et al., 1988; White et al., 1993; Kurz and Geist, 1999; Harpp and White, 2001]. Moreover, the Galapagos hot spot influences magmatism and tectonics on the GSC, an inference evident in correlated variations in geophysical, geochemical, and volcanological manifestations along the ridge [Detrick et al., 2002]. These variations along the GSC axis are more or less symmetric about 91.5W [Schilling et al., 2003]. The Galapagos mantle plume is characterized by both spatial (Hofmann White, 1982; White et al., 1993) and temporal geochemical variability (Blichert-Toft White, 2001; Hau et al., 2000a; Hoernle et al., 2004; Vidito et al., 2013; White et al., 1993). Thus, Galapagos lavas provide an unparalleled record of plume evolution as both the large igneous province (LIP) and older ocean island basalt (OIB) terranes (>50 Ma) are accreted in the Caribbean and in Central America (Denyer et al., 2006; Denyer Gazel, 2009; Hoernle et al., 2004; Sinton et al., 1998).
