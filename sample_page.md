## Seismic study of the crust beneath the Nortern Scandinavian mountains

**Project description:** The mechanism of support for the present topography of Scandinavia is not well explained by current crustal models. High topography in Norway and Sweden (Scandinavian Alps) is directly in contact with a relatively flat region (the Baltic shield). A crustal root beneath the Scandinavian Alps, expected from Airy isostatic calculations, is not present and the gravity anomaly map suggests lateral variations in density support present day topography. To bring new constrains on the variation of crustal properties we use P-receiver functions and ambient seismic noise.

### 4. Field works

The SCANLIPS3D experiment builds on existing work conducted in Norway and Sweden (SCANLIPS and SCANLIPS2) to investigate the possible cause of the geologically recent (Miocene) uplift which has affected Scandinavia.  

20 Guralp ESP (with 8 or 16 Gbytes of memory) 60 s period passive seismic instruments from the GEF were deployed in northern-central Norway in mid to late June 2013 and were recovered in early September 2014, providing 15 months of recording. The instruments were serviced in October 2013 and May 2014.
